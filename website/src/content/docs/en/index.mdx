## Quick Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StringKe/claudex/main/install.sh | bash
```

## How It Works

```
claudex run grok
    │
    ├── Start proxy → 127.0.0.1:13456
    │
    └── exec claude with:
        ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:13456/proxy/grok
        ANTHROPIC_MODEL=grok-3-beta
```

The proxy transparently translates between Anthropic and OpenAI protocols, so Claude Code works seamlessly with any supported provider.
