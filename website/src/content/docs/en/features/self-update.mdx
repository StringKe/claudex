Claudex can check for and install updates directly from GitHub Releases.

## Check for Updates

```bash
claudex update --check
```

This queries the GitHub API for the latest release and compares it with your installed version.

## Install Update

```bash
claudex update
```

This downloads the latest release binary for your platform, replaces the current binary, and verifies the installation.

## How It Works

1. Query GitHub API: `https://api.github.com/repos/StringKe/claudex/releases/latest`
2. Compare current version with latest release tag
3. Download the platform-specific archive (e.g., `claudex-v0.2.0-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`)
4. Extract and replace the running binary
5. Clean up temporary files

## Supported Platforms

The update mechanism supports the same platforms as the release builds:

| Platform | Target |
|----------|--------|
| macOS Intel | `x86_64-apple-darwin` |
| macOS Apple Silicon | `aarch64-apple-darwin` |
| Linux x86_64 | `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` |
| Linux ARM64 | `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` |
| Windows x86_64 | `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` |
