## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|

## Dashboard Layout

The dashboard displays:

- **Profile list** — All configured profiles with name, model, provider type, and health status
- **Health indicators** — Color-coded status (green = healthy, yellow = degraded, red = circuit breaker open)
- **Metrics panel** — Per-profile request count, success rate, average latency
- **Log panel** — Real-time scrolling log output

## Health Status

The dashboard runs a background health checker that pings all enabled profiles every ~30 seconds. Health status is reflected in real time:

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Green | Provider is responding normally |
| Yellow | Recent failures detected |
| Red | Circuit breaker is open |
| Gray | Profile is disabled |
