title: Circuit Breaker & Failover
description: Automatic failure detection and provider failover
---

Claudex includes a built-in circuit breaker for each provider profile, with automatic failover to backup providers when failures are detected.

## Circuit Breaker States

```
         success
    ┌──────────────┐
    │              │
    ▼    failure   │
 Closed ────────► Open
    ▲              │
    │   timeout    │
    │   expired    ▼
    └─────────── HalfOpen
                   │
                failure → back to Open
```

| State | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **Closed** | Normal operation. Requests pass through. Failures are counted. |
| **Open** | Requests are blocked. Triggers failover to backup providers. |
| **HalfOpen** | After recovery timeout, one probe request is allowed through. Success → Closed; Failure → back to Open. |

## Default Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Failure threshold | 3 consecutive failures |
| Recovery timeout | 30 seconds |

## Failover Configuration

Define backup providers in your profile to enable automatic failover:

```toml
[[profiles]]
name = "grok"
provider_type = "OpenAICompatible"
base_url = "https://api.x.ai/v1"
api_key = "xai-..."
default_model = "grok-3-beta"
backup_providers = ["deepseek", "chatgpt"]   # failover chain
```

When `grok` fails 3 times consecutively:
1. Circuit breaker opens for `grok`
2. Request is retried with `deepseek`
3. If `deepseek` also fails, try `chatgpt`
4. Each backup provider has its own independent circuit breaker

## Health Checking

A background health checker runs every ~30 seconds, sending lightweight probe requests to all enabled profiles. Health status is displayed in the TUI dashboard with color coding:

- Green: healthy
- Yellow: degraded (recent failures)
- Red: circuit breaker open
